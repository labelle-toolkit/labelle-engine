//! SpriteByField — declarative field-driven sprite selection.
//!
//! Complements `SpriteAnimation` (time-driven frame cycling) for the
//! other half of the prefab-animation RFC: cases where the sprite
//! follows the runtime value of a field on another component rather
//! than a frame timer. Canonical example: the hydroponics plant
//! overlay that swaps sprite based on `TendableWorkstation.level`
//! (0/1 → hidden, 2 → sapling_lvl1, 3 → sapling_lvl2, 4/5 → green).
//! Today that logic lives in a ~140-line tick script per use case
//! (`hydroponics_animation.zig`); this component collapses it to the
//! prefab data.
//!
//! See `labelle-engine/RFC-PREFAB-ANIMATION.md` for the full design.
//!
//! ## What this file ships
//!
//! Phase B slice of the animation RFC: the **pure state machine** —
//! component shape + `lookup(key)` method. The ECS tick system that
//! reads a field from a named component on each entity, coerces its
//! value to `i32`, looks up via `lookup`, and mutates the entity's
//! Sprite on match lands in a follow-up. Same staging as Phase A
//! (`sprite_animation.zig`).

/// Which entity carries the driving field.
///
/// - `.self` — read the field off this entity's own component of the
///   named type. Use when the sprite-bearing entity also holds the
///   state (rare for decoration).
/// - `.parent` — walk to the entity's parent first, then read. The
///   hydroponics case: the plant overlay is a child of the
///   workstation, and the driving `TendableWorkstation` lives on the
///   parent.

/// Drive `Sprite.sprite_name` from a runtime field value.
///
/// `component` is the serde name of the source component (e.g.
/// `"TendableWorkstation"`), `field` is the field on that component
/// to read (e.g. `"level"`). The engine tick system resolves both at
/// runtime through `ComponentRegistry.getType` + `std.meta.fieldIndex`
/// and coerces the resulting value to `i32` so integer fields
/// (signed or unsigned) and `enum` fields (via `@intFromEnum`) all
/// feed the same `lookup` table.
///
/// `entries` is parallel arrays — each `Entry.key` is matched against
/// the coerced field value; the first match wins and its
/// `sprite_name` is written onto the Sprite. A `null` `sprite_name`
/// means "hide the sprite" (the tick system toggles
/// `Sprite.visible = false` rather than setting a name) — used for
/// the hydroponics level 0/1 case.
///
/// ## Field lifetimes
///
/// `component`, `field`, and each entry's `sprite_name` are
/// **borrowed** — typically comptime string literals in the prefab,
/// or prefab-arena-owned slices. The component does not copy. Same
/// ownership contract as `PrefabInstance` / `PrefabChild` — see
/// `labelle-core/src/prefab.zig` for the full memory note.
///
/// ## Save policy
///
/// `.saveable` with the runtime `last_key_set` / `last_sprite_ptr`
/// cache skipped. On load, both reset and the next tick re-resolves
/// through the whole pipeline — a one-tick recheck is negligible
/// compared to saving the cache. Ensures save files stay small and
/// deterministic.
