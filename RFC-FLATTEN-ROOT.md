# RFC: Flatten the `root:` wrapper out of unified-format files

**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Alexandre
**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Bundled into:** v2.0.0 release (alongside engine#592 legacy-format removal)

## Problem

[RFC #560](./RFC-UNIFY-SCENES-AND-PREFABS.md) unified scenes and prefabs under a single shape where every file has a top-level `"root"` wrapper containing the entity definition. After six months of use, that wrapper is structural overhead that earns nothing — every file pays an extra indentation level for a key that conveys no information.

Real example from `flying-platform-labelle/prefabs/bandit_raid_enabled.jsonc`:

```jsonc
// today
{
    "root": {
        "components": {
            "BanditRaidEnabled": {}
        }
    }
}
```

Four lines and an indentation level to declare one component on one entity. FP has dozens of these "marker prefabs" — single-component, no children, pure tag. The `root:` wrapper is 50% of each file's byte count, and 100% of the keystrokes someone has to type before they can write what the file is actually about.

The same overhead shows up in scenes — every scene's entity list is one level deeper than it needs to be. And it accumulates: every reader's eye has to dismiss `root:` as boilerplate before it can read the actual content. Authoring tools have to indent everything one more time. Diff reviewers ignore the same key on every changed file.

## Why `root:` exists today

RFC #560's stated goal was that scenes and prefabs use the **same entity shape**. The wrapper was added as a docs/uniformity device — it gives the top-level entity an explicit name ("this is the scene's root entity" / "this is the prefab's root entity"). In code, the loader's `Value.getObject("root")` was a convenient unconditional entry point regardless of whether the file was a scene or a prefab.

The intent was correct. The implementation was over-engineered. The "name" the wrapper provides isn't queryable, isn't referenced anywhere else, and isn't surfaced in any tooling. It's purely a structural marker.

## Proposal

**Drop the `root:` wrapper.** Top-level keys of the file ARE the entity. Metadata keys (`name`, `version`) and entity-shape keys (`components`, `children`, `prefab`, `overrides`) coexist at the same level.

### Before / after — full coverage

**Component-only prefab:**

```jsonc
// today                                  // proposed
{                                          {
    "root": {                                  "components": {
        "components": {                            "BanditRaidEnabled": {}
            "BanditRaidEnabled": {}            }
        }                                  }
    }
}
```

**Prefab with children:**

```jsonc
// today                                            // proposed
{                                                    {
    "root": {                                            "components": {
        "components": {                                      "Workstation": { "kind": "bakery" }
            "Workstation": { "kind": "bakery" }          },
        },                                                   "children": [
        "children": [                                            { "prefab": "eis_slot" },
            { "prefab": "eis_slot" },                            { "prefab": "ios_slot" }
            { "prefab": "ios_slot" }                         ]
        ]                                                }
    }
}
```

**Prefab reference at root (specialization):**

```jsonc
// today                                            // proposed
{                                                    {
    "root": {                                            "prefab": "workstation_base",
        "prefab": "workstation_base",                    "overrides": {
        "overrides": {                                       "Workstation": { "kind": "bakery" }
            "Workstation": { "kind": "bakery" }          }
        }                                            }
    }
}
```

**Scene:**

```jsonc
// today                                            // proposed
{                                                    {
    "name": "main",                                      "name": "main",
    "root": {                                            "children": [
        "children": [                                        { "prefab": "background_sky" },
            { "prefab": "background_sky" },                  { "prefab": "ship_carcase" }
            { "prefab": "ship_carcase" }                 ]
        ]                                            }
    }
}
```

### Key sets are closed and disjoint

The proposal works because the top-level key sets are well-defined and don't overlap:

| Group       | Keys                                                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Metadata    | `name`, `version` *(future)*                           |
| Entity-inline | `components`, `children`                            |
| Entity-ref  | `prefab`, `overrides`                                  |
| Legacy *(removed in v2.0)* | `entities`, `assets`                    |

A file's "is this a reference or inline?" classification is the same predicate as today: does the top-level have `"prefab"`? Just looked up one level shallower.

### §B2 still applies

The "reference-mode entries cannot have children" rule (RFC #560 §B2, enforced engine-side in #586/#593) applies at the top-level just like it applies in `root.children`. A file shaped `{"prefab": "x", "children": [...]}` is still a load-time error.

### Loader changes

`src/jsonc/unified_format.zig` and `src/jsonc/scene_loader.zig` switch on `"root"` presence:

- **No `root` key** → top-level keys are the entity. Read `components` / `children` / `prefab` / `overrides` directly.
- **`root` key present** → legacy unified-format. Use today's code path.

During v1.x: both accepted, no warning. At v2.0: root-wrapped path removed alongside the other legacy paths.

(Rationale for no v1.x warning: this is a stylistic change, not a correctness one. Spamming deprecation warnings during a normal release would be annoying. The migrator handles the cleanup; the audit detects it.)

### Audit + migrator

`labelle audit unification` (cli#232, extended in cli#236) gets a fourth legacy finding type:

```
[unified-format] redundant "root" wrapper: lift its contents to the file's top level (RFC #560 phase 2)
```

A new `labelle migrate unified` subcommand (or `--fix` mode on the audit) performs the mechanical transform: parse, lift, write back with comment preservation (Strategy B byte-offset edits, same as today's earlier migration in FP).

## Sequence with v2.0

| Step | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| 1 | v1.47.0 (or next minor) | Loader accepts both forms. Audit detects legacy root wrapper. |
| 2 | v1.47.x | `labelle migrate unified` ships. Projects can clean up at their own pace. |
| 3 | v2.0.0 | Loader drops root-wrapped path. Also drops legacy `entities` / `components-on-ref` / `assets` / `.initial_scene`. Single breaking bump. |

Step 1 is the smallest engine PR — add the no-root branch in the loader, audit walker extension, no warnings. Step 2 is the migrator (could be the same PR, or a follow-up). Step 3 deletes code.

## Open questions

1. **Tooling acceptance criteria for v2.0**: should we gate the v2.0 ship on "all toolkit-managed projects (bouncing-ball, every assembler example, FP) run cleanly through `labelle audit unification` with the new detection enabled"? Today's audit on the same set surfaced drift the migration agents missed; same gating policy seems wise.

2. **`labelle init` template hygiene**: today's `labelle init` emits the root-wrapped shape. If we ship step 1 in v1.47, should the generator immediately emit flat form (silent style preference) or keep emitting root-wrapped until v2.0 (status quo for migration runway)? I lean toward switching the generator immediately — new projects get the better shape from day one, the audit can still detect the old shape for projects that were generated earlier.

3. **Bundle scope**: is there other silent renaming or deprecated-but-still-accepted surface we should fold into the v2.0 bump while it's open? Worth a focused sweep before committing.

4. **`name` field positioning**: in the flat form, `name` is a top-level metadata key sitting alongside `components`/`children`. Should we make the order canonical (metadata first, then entity-shape) and have the audit warn on out-of-order files? My instinct is no — JSON object order doesn't matter for the loader, and forcing it adds review friction for negligible gain.

5. **What about `.initial_prefab` in `project.labelle`?** Unaffected — that's a `project.labelle` field, not an entity-tree file. Unchanged by this RFC. (Legacy `.initial_scene` removal is in engine#592 phase 1 work.)

## Non-goals

- Schema validation / `.labelle.schema.json` — separate concern, not part of this RFC.
- Per-entity metadata fields (`tags`, `id`, etc.) — orthogonal.
- Versioned scene/prefab format — that would deserve its own RFC if pursued.
- Changes to `project.labelle` structure — unchanged.
