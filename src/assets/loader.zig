//! Asset entry state, loader vtable + decoded payload / uploaded
//! resource unions.
//!
//! Owns the shared types that both the catalog and the concrete loaders
//! (image, audio, font) need. Keeping them here avoids a circular
//! dependency: `catalog.zig` imports this file; this file does not
//! import `catalog.zig`.
//!
//! Concrete loaders live in `loaders/` and provide a
//! `pub const vtable: AssetLoaderVTable` that the catalog stores on
//! each `AssetEntry` at registration time.
//!
//! ## Where does the uploaded GPU/device handle live?
//!
//! `AssetEntry.decoded` holds the worker-thread CPU-side payload
//! (RGBA pixels for images, sample buffers for audio, glyph rasters
//! for fonts). After `loader.upload` runs on the main thread, we also
//! need a slot for the post-upload "real thing" — a GPU texture
//! handle, an audio device id, a font atlas pointer, … — so `pump()`
//! (#442), `isReady`, and the eventual unload path (#446) can see it
//! without walking private loader state.
//!
//! Phase 1 picks **option 1** from the #440 ticket: extend `AssetEntry`
//! with a second `resource: ?UploadedResource` field, parallel to the
//! existing `decoded`. This keeps the CPU-side and GPU-side slots
//! independent, matches the RFC §2 sketch ("decoded: union { texture,
//! audio, font }"), and survives the #441 / #442 / #446 tickets cleanly.
//! The alternative — reusing `decoded` as a "before OR after" union —
//! was rejected because Zig unions are comptime-tagged so the variant
//! types have to be decided up front.
